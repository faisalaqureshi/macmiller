I'm just tryna play it cool, J (Anyways)\nYeah, mind over matter, I'm purer than alkaline\nBeen stuck on album time, I gotta get out to shine\nFly on the wall, shit, I was buggin'\nMiss me like you gettin' withdrawal, I keep that comin', yeah\nI'm treadin' water, I know\nIf I stop movin', I'll float\nThey nothin' new, it\u2014\nJust play it cool, baby, just play it cool\nYou know, cool\n\nWell, it ain't perfect but I don't mind\nBecause it's worth it\nWho really has the time at all?\nIt ain't perfect but I don't mind\n'Cause on the surface I look so fine\nBut really I'm buggin', buggin'\nMakin' somethin' out of nothin'\n\nYeah, tell me you love me, spin me around\nPretty please, pick me up in the air and don't put me down\nSeen it all unfold, sat back and watched\nKnowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop\nBare feet, runnin' late, her car started\nEven though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain\nMore important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but\nShe put me back together when I'm out of order\nPerfect"
