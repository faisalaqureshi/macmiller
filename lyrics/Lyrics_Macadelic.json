I got a lot of ammo\nYou ain't a soldier 'cause you rockin' camo\nYoung Rambo, hundred million fans though\nAnd I do it big, you a iPod Nano\nFire on wax, look like I brought candles\nYeah, you got a show, but you ain't on my channel\nThat's HBO, bitch, you gotta pay for that\nAha-ha-ha\nYour channel's free\nAha-ha-ha (I'm gonna fucking kill you)\nUh\nIMAX some shit motherfucker, yeah, suck my dick\n\nHey\nAyo, I'm 'bout to start gambilin' with Ambien, I'm dutch smokin'\nThat's a strike but fuck bowlin', I could tear a pin of Maryland\nSee, I'm American, apparently it's damagin'\nTo be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn\nMonroe-lookin' dumb hoes who want too much dough\nAnd come close to have you straight trippin' when you jump rope\nDon't rock the love boat, this business fuckin' cutthroat\nAnd it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat\nRooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog\nThese rappers who be hatin' probably need to get a job\nSee, me, I'm with my squad, gettin' money, livin' comfortable\nI know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though\nFuck a toast, y'all is fuckin' broke, cut ya throat\nJudgin' me is nothin' dope, boy, you lyin' under oath\nGod made the world, why did man make the scriptures?\nAnd if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?\nI could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture\nOf the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters\nI'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold\nIf my skin gets filled up, I'ma tat my soul\nRunnin' out of paper, writin' on my hand\nHundred thousand haters writin' 'bout my jams\nWant a number one independent album? I'm your man\nI'ma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand\n16Embed"

I need a cup\nNo, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff\nI could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?\nGo 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free\n\nThey just dreams, turn 'em to reality\nDouble-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony\nLookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine\nAll we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?\nThey just dreams, turn 'em to reality\nDouble-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony\nLookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine\nAll we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?\nWhat the\u2014, what the fuck is time?

I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?\nWhat do you do when you think you could be a icon?\n'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on\nLike they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat\nRacin' to the gate but my flight gone\nAnd now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon\nBut I don't fight though, figure it's a typo\nSeems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though\nPotion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down (Aha)\nSee, that's exactly what I need\nMy khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat\nLike it was \"Donald Trump,\" a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck\nThey throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club\nHey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this\nWell, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface\nLearn quick, now I'm big time\nFill ya cup up, and I'ma sip mine\n\nFill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality\nDouble-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony\nLookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine\nAll we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?\nThey just dreams, turn 'em to reality\nDouble-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony\nLookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine\nAll we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?\nWhat the\u2014, what the fuck is time?

Please don't fuck up my chi\nYeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion\nWaste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction\nFell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan\nBallin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon\nA penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams\nA price on a idea, we never can agree\nThey tell you what to know, but it's better to believe\nSo why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?\nStill I tell em, \"Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable\"\nJust continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't\nYou spent your days countin' every single penny made\nRestart now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways\n\nStay high\nGo for what you know (Yeah)\nLet it in your mental (Macadelic)\nAnd don't ever let it go\nIt ain't never gon' stop, 'cause\nYou can't fight the feeling\n(No) Feeling\nYou can't fight the feeling, no\nUh, I told you it won't stop, 'cause\nYou can't fight the feeling\nFeeling\nYou can't fight the feeling, no\nSometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her\nWrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up\nHours upon days just to find power shit to say\nBut you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean\nThe sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually\nSo what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?\nIdentity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness\nJesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent\nSold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless\nMy focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans\nThat coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game\nI'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame\nThe emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me\nThat you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see\nI'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever\nYour tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you\n\nYou can't fight the feeling\nFeeling\nYou can't fight the feeling, no\nIt won't stop!\nYou can't fight the feeling\nFeeling\nYou can't fight the feeling, no\nFuck me\nI want you to fuck me (I want you to fuck me)\nI want you to fuck me (Oh yeah)\nOh, fuck\nOh, fuck\nOh, fuck\nDon't stop\nStop55Embed"

Say the word, but she can't\nLookin' in my eyes, \"Is everything okay?\"\nShe lies, put on her disguise, play it safe\n'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks\nShe keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak\nStrong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on\nI don't wanna be sober long\nSo you need to get me high again\nI got all this money we could try to spend\nUntil we strung out like a violin\nCome back to life, then we die again\nLittle angel, where's your halo?\nSomewhere above them horns\nSomethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more\nDone a lotta drugs, never felt like this before\nI hope one day it all makes sense\nIt'll all make sense\nAnd you could have it all, tell me what you need\nBelievin' all them silly things you read\nI hope one day it all makes sense\nOne day it'll all make sense\n\nUh\nYou get me high, girl, scared to overdose\nI don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose\nMay I propose a toast? Someone usually does\nTo our fucked up love\nYou get me high, girl, scared to overdose\nI don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose\nPropose a toast? Someone usually does\nTo our fucked up love\n\nSomethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more\nDone a lotta drugs, never felt like this before\n*Snorts*\n*Exhales*\nAnd you could have it all, tell me what you need\nBelievin' all them silly things you read\nDon't cry, it's okay\nIt'll all be over soon8Embed"

High, more drinkin'\nNow my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?\nPain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source\nBear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list\nTry to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted\nAncient, halucinatin' visions of utopia\nUntil I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one\nNever hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun\nAnd I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run\nMac Miller, I'm the only one\nBut I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium\n\nGot my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)\nWelcome to America (Uh)\nMotherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)\nMy middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)\nHands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)\nWelcome to America (Uh)\nMotherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)\nStill, in a room filled with holographic images\nCrushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it\nDirectly to my head, never sleep or use my bed\nIller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed\nMight head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest\nHop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress (Uh)\nSee, this is what I do the best\nNothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest\nSave hard, a Braveheart, a warrior\nI take part to stay far from coroners\nI heard some corny words said about my music though\nTalkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho\nMost Dope, got you hooked, yellin', \"Rufio\"\nFirst you lose your mind, then you lose your soul\nSo what you talkin' about? Thinkin' you out of options\nAmerican born, impeccable form\nAbove and beyond, never the norm\n\nGot my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)\nWelcome to America (Uh)\nMotherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)\nMy middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)\nHands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)\nWelcome to America (Uh)\nMotherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)\nYo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her\nShout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers\nI'll be shaded up at the villa\nWith a girl that know what the deal is\nYeah, they know I come from the illest\nCity on the map, we don't know how to act, ah!\nRealest young rap go-getters in America\nBad chicks get tossed around like the merry-go\nCV and Mac Meezy takin' off on PJ's\nWe the future, so every night is a new day\nSittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low\nYoung visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show\nI can trigger the wave in my sleep\nName paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat, ah!\nWake up shower, get paid and repeat\nSpit one flow and got made on the streets\nWelcome to the land where you never stay for free\nSwag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal\nVeggies\n\nGot my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)\nWelcome to America (Uh)\nMotherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)\nMy middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)\nHands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)\nWelcome to America (Uh)\nMotherfucker, welcome to America (Yeah)\n'Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick\nRollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' Mach 6\nRise to the top and topics change\nTo Glocks and the Stock Exchange\nNow watch the price of life on the block drop, insane\nYou can't stop this reign, don't name-drop in vain\nInhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward, strange\nLast week he was nothin', boxers stain\nNow everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame\nTo the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat\nNo deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes\nSun got shine, now they say he shady, but he never dippin' though\nStill facin' L's, you would think a nigga wins was low\nWhat you think I'm in this for?\nWon't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope\nEnd the flow or behind bars, droppin' prison soap\nBeggin' for forgiveness, but it's business though\nI'm record spittin' Guinness flows\nGot it up in sources, now he in the store\n20Embed"
