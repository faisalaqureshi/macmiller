(Hide away)\nPoseidon triumph in the eyes of rain\nWon't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today (Die today)\nI'll greet the devil with a smilin' face (Smilin' face)\nShit, that God fellow may reside in space\nAs, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons\nMy girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' (Keep changin')\nDreamin' of places, my own personal creations\nIf there's a party in Heaven I plan to leave wasted (Leave wasted)\nRetracin' my steps way back to Biblical times\nWe-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line\nAnd these words that I command you today shall be in your heart\nAnd you shall teach them diligently to your children\nAnd you shall speak of them when you sit at home\nAnd when you walk along the way, and when you lie down\nAnd when you rise up, I am the lord, your god"

(All this money)\nBack in high school, none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)\nI thought it was a conspiracy\nSometimes my thoughts start scarin' me\nYou a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets\nThey, they, they been lookin' for somebody like me\nBig bag of weed and a muddy iced tea\nSomethin' brand new, wonder what it might be\nYou party off them drugs, movin' at a nice speed\nIf you eighteen years and older\nEighteen years and older\nIf you eighteen years and older\nEighteen years and older\n\nI wanna rule the world, take care of my family\nAnd take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds\nBlaze a gang of trees\nWent to see a rated R movie 'bout me\nThey said you must be\nEighteen years and older\nEighteen years and older\nEighteen years and older\nEighteen years and older\nEighteen years and older"

What does it mean?\nYou wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin'\nWhy aren't you chasin' your dreams, ugh?\nWe wonder 'bout life, but none of us willin' to learn\nThe money we earn is somethin' to burn\nWhy won't they give me a turn? I'll\nFeed the hungry and clothe the naked\nYou mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?\nWhen them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion\nContaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day\nI waste away in a room spittin' these raps\nYahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, yep\n\nIt's a gift\n(Our) Our time to be alive\nNo earthly vehicle\nCan contain this drive\nIt's a gift\n(Our) Our time to be alive\nNo earthly vehicle\nCan contain this drive\n\nForfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away\nGrabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate\nDealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbin' souls forgotten\nHe lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', \"Not today\"\nLife's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious\nFight to the death 'til there's nobody left\nAnd you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected\nI'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic\nBe specific, to those in control we all statistics\nMisogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined\nMy trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time\u2014*Bang*\nInitial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior\nThe mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior\nThe newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers\n'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers\nA news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature\nYou a hater? I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya\nI'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors\nReally Doe, come on, homie, we major\nI waste away in this room spittin' out raps\nYahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back\n\nIt's a gift\n(Our) Our time to be alive\nNo earthly vehicle\nCan contain this drive\nIt's a gift\n(Our) Our time to be alive\nNo earthly vehicle\nCan contain this drive\n\n\nIt's just a different time, man\nIt's just a different time\nThere was a time\nWhen we showed love\nDa, da-da, da-da, da-da\nYou know like how we (Da, da-da, da-da, da-da)\nApproach a young lady (Oh-whoa)\nYou see a beautiful young lady, you like (Oh-whoa)\nYou say, damn, man (La, da-da, da-da, da-da)\nYou're gorgeous (Da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da)\nI'll take off my coat right now and (Dum, la-da-da)\nLay it down on the puddle and (Dum)\nMake sure you don't miss a step (Da, da-da, da-da, da-da)\nDa, da-da, da-da, da-da\nYou know what I'm talkin' 'bout, young man?

Can you hide away?\nSound of silence as they all just watch you\nI kinda find it strange how the times have changed\nI wish we could go and be\nFree once, baby, you and me\nWe could change the world forever\nAnd never come back again\nLet's leave it all in the rear-view\nLet's leave it all in the rear-view, girl\nYou don't have to cry\nYou don't have to cry\nMend a broken heart, girl, if you can\nI don't expect you to be capable\nYou got the world right in your hands\nThat responsibility is unescapable\nI promise that I'll be a different man\nPlease give me the chance to go and live again\nI'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?\nIt seems perfection really is so unattainable\nDon't even say you 'bout to end it all\nYour life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself\nI'm not so sure that there's an end at all\nI wish the truth would just reveal itself\nWho do you call to make it to the top?\nAnd who do you call to make the shootin' stop?\nAnd who do you call to give the coupe a wash?\nAfter everything I did, I think I'm still myself\n\nJust a little taste and you know she got you\nCan you hide away? Can you hide away?\nSound of silence as they all just watch you\nI kinda find it strange how the times have changed\nI wish we could go and be\nFree once, baby, you and me\nWe could change the world forever\nAnd never come back again\nLet's leave it all in the rear-view\nLet's leave it all in the rear-view, girl\nYou don't have to cry\nYou don't have to cry"

Go 'head and rap now\nDo what you do best\nI mean, that's what you do best\nMatter fact, motherfucker, you a suit vest, you need to buy a new dress\nI heard you and your girl live in a duplex\nI'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west\nIf you got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothin'\"\nMy milk and honey, my ch\u00e9rie-ch\u00e9rie amore\nMy Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway\nHer ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow\nAnd the lion through the forest\nTo the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay\nRemember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard\nWhen he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard\nNow the whole world's in color, still\nHow Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real\nHer face was careworn\nI suspect she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn\nAnd had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginnin' of year one\nMr. Candyman, the parables parabolic\nThe poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes\nLightnin' should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet\nThe Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet\nAnd yell, \"Hear, hear,\" finally some order to this rap shit\nFinally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips\nI keep my shit crispy and elegant\nSo miss me with the irrelevant, the godbody is heaven-sent\nThe hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford\nBrother of Fal, every rhyme's halal\nEvery line is kosher, livin' la vida loca\nShout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to..."

He was part-lion\"\nLife goes on, the tears all dried and\nCouple years are gone by by then, uh\nCan you please help me find my friend?\nI give you anything you need multiplied by ten\nI heard he moved to a place where the time don't end\nSo you don't need money, all you got is time to spend\nYeah, life's short, don't ever question the length\nIt's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength\nI recommend no limits, intricate thought\nGo 'head, just give it a shot, you'll remember shit you forgot\n\n'Cause way back then I didn't know shit\nAnd I don't know shit now\nWhen the world's lookin' hopeless\nI'ma still hold shit down\n\nI remember\nWhen we were just kids\nWe knew nothing at all\nAnd we would talk about the life we lived in\nWest Virginia\nLost somewhere out in\nWest Virginia\n"
