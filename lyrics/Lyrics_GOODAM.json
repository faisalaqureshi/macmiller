(Down)\nAnd I'm the chosen one\nLookin' all around, what has the world become? Um\nThe only way to change it is to burn it to the ground (Ground)\nI've been gettin' paid\nAbout four or five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain\nThis money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'ma drown (Drown) (Yeah)\nYou've never been better than me\nFrom this prison, I'm settin' 'em free\nOpen eyes, I'ma let you see\nThis world just like our dreams\nI'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday\nI'm runnin' to the edge\nAnd when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump\nTo see if I can fly, fly\nI wonder if I jump, jump\nDo you think that I can fly, fly?\n\nYeah\nIt's the life of a entertainer\nI need that check, go and get the waiter\nFuck a troll, this destruction mode\nAnd these explosions don't need detonators\nI met my maker in a elevator, he was headed to the top floor\nWe're quite similar\nWe just did our work, but we were in it for a lot more\nWe would try to change the world, but we got bored\nWhen I rip this show, got a encore\nBack when we were still in school\nWe didn't listen to the list of rules\nWrote a million words on the chalkboard\nI don't need answers to the questions of intangibles\nI told my homies, \"The top so lonely\nBut we ain't gonna die, not now\" (Now)\nYou gon' make it here, live free tonight 'til the day appear\nLet's sit back right where we at and let this money pile (Pile)\nHow do we get rich? If she actin' crazy, you don't need that bitch\nWish I knew back then all the things that I know now (Now)\nGo on and on, knew I had this shit all along\nTake a breath, feel this moment, hold it just so you can (Can)\nLook where we at and look where we came from\nWhen will we wake up? Lost in translation\n\nYou've never been better than me\nFrom this prison, I'm settin' 'em free\nOpen eyes, I'ma let you see\nThis world just like our dreams\nI'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday\nI'm runnin' to the edge\nAnd when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump\nTo see if I can fly, fly\nI wonder if I jump, jump\nDo you think that I can fly, fly?11Embed"

(Back)\nSomewhere in between the crazy and the conscious (Conscious)\nShe's naked underneath them shadows\nLet the sunlight undress her slow\nI don't know who I am, I'm so good at doin' impressions though (Uh-huh)\nI'm goin' to the festival, (The festival) need to let me go\nI wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep\nIt's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be\n'Cause actually the master fast asleep\nAnd the castles back-back in his private quarters (Private quarters)\nThat's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order (No, no, no)\nAll this torture, thought I had to warn ya (Had to warn ya)\nLeave it all behind and go to California (California) (Go, go)\nI'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzin' this feelin'\nYa can't fathom (Can't fathom) (Can't, can't, can't)\n(Festival, festival, festival, festival)\nMy hands are above the clouds\nFrom the clap-clap thunder lookin' down\nWhile you're runnin' around\nI lift you up when you drown\nUnlock the mission, the planet in rotation\nFull speed chasin' and you're always runnin' ahead\nYou're always runnin' ahead\nYou got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances\nAnd you battle like a champion, why\nDo you wanna go, do you wanna go\nDo you wanna go to the festival?\nYou got angels weepin', see them drippin' from the sky\nYou watch 'em with your third eye (So, so, so)\nDo you wanna go, do you wanna go\nDo you wanna go to the festival? (To the festival)\nTo the festival (To the festival)\nTo the festival (To the festival)\nFestival (Festival)\nFestival (Festival)\n\n\nHola, Malcolm\nHey, man, it's, it's Luis, man\nI'm calling, man, tell you about the album\nI listen, it's good\nI need to tell you, man\nI tell everyone to, to listen to the music\nAnd it sound like they like it, man\nIt sound like they good. I tell my wife, \"I'm so proud of him.\"\nI tell my girlfriend, \"I'm so proud of him.\"\nAnd the album is good\nIt's so good\nI cannot believe\nAnyone can be you\nNo one can beat you15Embed"
