(Go)\nNo time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)\nBy now, this life is all I know\nSo this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)\nTaught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)\nHey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)\nSo make a toast to a good life (Good life)\nHey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan\nListenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van\nThis is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code\nHappy as hell, MDMA, yo\nFuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss\nWe just tryna work so we can blow up like a Molotov\nAnd it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop\nThinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust\nGot me thankful just for life by itself\nAnd there's way more people here I should be tryna help\nAm I wrong for spendin' money how I do? (Prolly yes)\nIt's just funny old people see the logo on my chest\nYou got ya thumb held high? We can be friends\nOther people pretend we hang out on the weekends\nThese fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them\nSay, \"Get some rest,\" when I die, I'ma sleep in\n\nAyo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)\nThinking to myself, where does all this go?
