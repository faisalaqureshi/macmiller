We balling like the Rockets\nAnd now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets\nHigh honor roll, but not thinking 'bout a college\nLove with these rhymes, want the cover of Time\nMan of the Year, got my image stuck in your mind\nHold up one second\nGirl, this my last L, I'ma roll it up with you\nCop some brand new shoes, put me in a good mood\nI'ma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends\nIs there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?\nBeing young so fun, I don't ever want to age\nHaven't came down in the past five days\nJust trying to tell it like it is, we the shit\nYou now dealing with some motherfuckin' kids\nWhat?\nRostrum Records in this bitch (Hah-hah)\nThank y'all for tuning in (What up, E?)\nLet me do what I do\nMost Dope, thumbs up, Pittsburgh\nWhat up, Taylor Gang?\nRD, ID Labs, Benji\nBig Jerm, everybody, man\nLet's do it, yeah\nIt's my time right now\nK.I.D.S., kicking some incredibly dope shit\nBitch5Embed"
