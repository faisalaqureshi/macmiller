    "lyrics": "I Love Life, Thank You Lyrics\n\"I'd say there was as much dope in the music business as there is in virtually any other business now. The dope is so out in the open that you can go anywhere, and it's there. So there's no, sort of, underground movement of people taking dope, you know? The most extraordinary, straight people are taking dope. It's available anywhere, at any time, and it's all over the place. If you want it, you can have it, you know?\"\nAlright then, bitch\nHa, ya\nUh\nA million ma'fuckin' fans on that ass, biotch!
