Okay... love\nLove, love, love, love, love (Sex)\nLove, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)\n\nThis sun don't shine when I'm alone\nI lose my mind and I lose control\nI see your eyes look through my soul\nDon't be surprised, this all I know\nI felt the highs and they feel like you\nSee, a love like mine is too good to be true\nAnd you too divine to just be mine\nYou remind me of the color blue\nGirl, I'm so in love with you, yeah\nGirl, I'm so in love with you\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah\nUm, well\n\nBaby, you were everything I ever wanted\nBought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket\nPlanned to ask the other day\nKnew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it\nRemember when you went away to college?\nHours on the phone, we end up talkin'\nPast, present, future, all the gossip, God damn\nPuppy love ain't what it was, darlin'\nFeelings that we have are so alarmin'\nI can make you laugh, I can break the glass\nIf we made it last, it'd be a bargain\nMr. Charmin', that is my department\nYou was there before the fancy cars and\nYou was there when I was just a starvin' artist\nWhen the car was havin' trouble startin'\nNow we got our own apartment, same box for the mail\nSame hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale\nAnd this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale\nI tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed\nYou said, \"All you ever think about is sex\"\nI'm like, \"Oh well, you know me so well\nAnd if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell\nAnd every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell\nI swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail\"\nWell, I'm the jealous type\nBut I swear that ass is what Heaven's like\nAnd when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life\nThat's the only way I'm tryna end the night\nIt's my only chance, I better get it right\nTake your time, my baby\nIt's all waitin' for you, for you\nI know I make your mind go crazy\nBut it's all waitin' right here for you, for you\n\nYou get closer with, run away\nAll I ever known is the color gray\nYour lovely ways bring me sunshine\nI found an angel so divine\nHeaven probably not the same without you\nBut now you're in my world, in my world\nAh-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah-ah"

Bring me to life\nNo matter what, one day everyone dies (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)\nYou think you a God 'til you run out of time (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)\nYeah, said, when you're gone (Gone), what will you leave behind?\nYeah, do I belong sometime soon? Where goes my mind? (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)\n\nYou the one to show me\nDivine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love\nWhere was you when I was lonely\nMy divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love?\nWhen the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear\nBaby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?\nI'm right here\nYeah, why do you stay on my case?\nI try to make you feel okay\nDo you know (Do you know) I'm in pain?\nI give you clues, you misconstrued\nYou continue to push me far away\nWhy don't you call my name?\nIt's like you forgot my face\nI just wanna taste of everything you made of\nWe ain't (Nothing)\nCut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly\nYeah, said, when are you comin' through to free my mind?\nAre you happy with your life?\nCan I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside\nWhen you take off all your clothes, I am under your control\nRollin' up, you get me high (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh; alright)\n\nYou the one to show me\nDivine love, love, love, love\nWhere was you when I was lonely\nMy divine love, love, love, love?\nWhen the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear\nBaby, where'd you go?

We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think \"what a cute guy,\" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...\nSo, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other."
