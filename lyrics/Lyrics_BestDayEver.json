(Yeah)\nIt's unbelievable, these people say I made it\nThrowin' down a little Henny, can't believe that I don't chase it\nLife goes on, days get brighter\nI'm feelin' like I came in with my haze, no lighter\nSo I'm lookin' for the missin' piece\nGoin' down in history for rippin' beats\nSmooth game, sweeter than a Krispy Kreme\nYou tune into my station, hope you listening\nTurn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream\nAll-natural Whole Foods that lay you back\nHave you straight chillin' in a dope mood\nAnd some shit is happy like a show tune\nThis a brand new world, I can show you (Yeah)\nSome people still have no clue\nBut they can look at all this cheese that I produce\n\nIn a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down\nYou in or you out, you smile or you frown\nJust get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)\nIn a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down\nYou in or you out, you smile or you frown\nJust get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)\nHey\nAyo, I'm fast lane switchin', rap game spittin'\nChillin' with some sour, got a bad dame twistin' (Yeah)\nThese people think I'm goofy, say I'm Max, they trippin'\n'Cause life a comedy like my last name Griffin\nLivin' for the moment, blowin' potent, overloaded\nAnd my swagger, call me Old Spice\nYeah, the kid is so nice\nSmokin' in the whip, chillin', duckin' from the po-lice\nSo bright, you no lights, I'm shinin' like a strobe light\nLeave a show with money, and I always count my dough twice\nMost Dope general, and that shit is fo' life\nMy mama taught me well, so I even treat these hoes right, I'm po-lite\nWorkin' in my office, but no Dwight\nCoke-white skinded, no light dimness\nMe, who I am, plain sight for these bitches (Yeah)\nAnd I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches\nI don't got time to spend a night with these bitches\n\nIn a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down\nYou in or you out, you smile or you frown\nJust get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)\nIn a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down\nYou in or you out, you smile or you frown\nJust get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)\nYeah"

Ain't that some shit?\nTake over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit\nLook at all this money! Ain't that some shit? (Hey)\n\nWe gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad\nThat's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have\nAnd they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw\nWhat I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras\nWe gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad\nTake over the world, watch these haters get mad\nThat's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have\nHop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap\nUh, uh, uh\nAnd ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid\nStyle come with excellence and money make benevolence\nIrrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent\nI kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it\nTell a bitch that she better bring her friends\nAnd if she want an autograph she better bring a pen\nYeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend\nAnd if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10\nI ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky\nWhen the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly\n\nBut I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit\nLook at all this money! Ain't that some shit?\n\nWe gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad\nThat's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have\nAnd they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw\nWhat I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras\nWe gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad\nTake over the world, watch these haters get mad\nThat's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have\nHop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap"

Just wait until I pull my cape out\nHey, life is good, don't waste it\nWe ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces\n\nOne day, I'ma be so rich that I can buy my moms a house\nHave a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch\nI'ma have 'em like\nOy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow\nOy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow\nIt seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like\nOy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow\n\nHey, they seem surprised, with the look that's in their eyes\nHow I could be myself and do away with their disguise\nI advise homies to stay homies\nFew people you can trust, all the OG's told me\nWhen I was just a shawty, strummin' my guitar\nPlayin' my piano, had a band in my garage\nSittin' down with the homies, playin' PlayStation\nTryna find a crib where their parents on vacation\nHey, why you grillin'? Put a smile on your face, bitch\nWe takin' shots all around, gettin' wasted\nCame a long way from freestylin' in my basement\nShow some love to the people that I came with 'cause...\nDay in and day out\nWe tryna get this cake now\nYou think you fly? Just wait until I pull my cape out\nHey, life is good, don't waste it\nWe ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces\n\nOne day, I'ma be so rich that I can buy my moms a house\nHave a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch\nI'ma have 'em like\nOy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow\nOy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow\nIt seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like\nOy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow"

You didn't think I was gonna make a song for you, did you?)\nFor the good times or bad, I'll be there\nHey, hey, haha\nHey, hey\nSome shit ya just gotta say\nMm-hmm, like\nUh-huh"

(Wake up)\nI ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)\n'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do\nSo I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)\nHit snooze, I ain't tryna wake up yet\nI'ma keep on dreamin', be the straight-up best\nAnd I'm blessed, everyday I'm gettin' straight-up fresh\nMy homies like, \"Mac, damn, you get your cake up\"\nYes, I did, that's the life I live, I grind all day\nHigh school, sellin' mixtapes in the hallway\nI bet they never thought I'd be this cool\nNow they understand why I skip school\nHad my dreams, wasn't worried at all\nThat's why if I'm gettin' bored, I go splurge at the mall\nI got money (I got money), I got bitches (I got bitches)\nI got everything they dreamin' of, and I ain't done shit yet\nThis major leagues, big business\nUsed to have a wish list, now I just give gifts\nShit, it make me happy\nHere's how to reach me, you can get at me\n\nNow my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer\nWe be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high\nNow the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'\nI be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'\nWhen the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)\nI ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)\n'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do\nSo I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)\nWhen the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)\nI ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? (Wake up)\n'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do\nSo I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze (Snooze)\n\nNow my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer\nWe be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high\nNow the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'\nI be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'\nWhen the fuck will I wake up?
