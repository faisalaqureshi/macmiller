Can you feel it?\n\nUh, polo pajamas; I think I made it\nI showed my mom my first million; she damn near fainted\nThe rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance\nThe legends put out their latest, I feel that it sound outdated\nI'm the hardest workin' person in the universe\nTemptation, victim to the church of Lucifer\nInternet rappers ain't shit when no computers work\nYou spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse\n(A Gucci verse?) I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest\nAnd I don't hold a grudge against anybody who hate it\nI'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist\nIf I ain't in your top ten, then you a racist\nCocaine ether creates a strange creature\nThey wasn't hearin' me 'til I fucked with a Brainfeeder\nI'm still playin' it out the same speakers\nI did it all without a Drake feature\nSo many things that I've created\nBut this right here might be my favorite\nThey ask me how I feel, I say, \"Amazin'\"\nI feel amazin'\nSo many things that I've created\nBut this right here might be my favorite\n\nYeah\nBrand-new home, I think I made it\nKey to the city, I keep to open the gates wit'\nA briefcase with a million under the pavement\nThat's just on some rainy day shit, yeah\nThe kids gettin' murdered that I grew up wit'\nThey shootin' up, doin' drugs or they doin' nothin'\nMy girl's parents still livin' out in the hood\nI come through in that new Bimmer like the shit all good, damn\nI'm just a human; let me make mistakes\nShit has changed, ain't little Malcolm with the baby face\nEven my homies tell me, \"Take a break\"\nThey know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste\nTryna be a legend by tomorrow\nThey say I can't, I'm determined to prove 'em wrong though\nI'm not perfect, but they ain't either\nI did it all without a Jay feature\n32Embed"

Tell me what you made of\nWhat are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust\nLa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nLa-da-da-da, la-da-da (Just a little angel dust)\nLa-da-da-da (Yeah,) la-da-da-da (Yeah)\nLa-da-da-da, ayy (It's just a little angel dust)\n\nYeah\nI'm playin' hot potato on a Winnebago\nThe chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso\nAnd what's an angel with a missin' halo?\nShe would drop outta school to take a trip to DayGlow\nFound a twenty layin' by the sewer rats\nYou know little Stuart hasn't been in any movies lately\nHe's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex\nHis agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial\nWhat I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue\nNot Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food\nHurry to make the first move, I'm walkin' like Herschel\nAnd now we at the end of verse two, oh\n\nDon't be scared, just come with me, yeah\nFeels so good to feel this free\nWhat are you afraid of?

Not masseur, masseuse. But, it doesn't matter! Do you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, every forty-eight hours to see if there's any change in his physical condition? Do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad & Tobago? But it doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! I tell you it just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! Even if we win... if we win, ha! Even if we win! Even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to ten days, even if God in Heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field, even if every man, woman, and child held hands together and prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter!\n\nYeah\nYeah\nUm, um\nJumpin' out the Camino\nJust left the gas station, smell like Hot Cheetos\nRecordin' soft-core on her Tivo\nMa, the meatloaf!\nRe-smoke, got a vegan bitch in the Peace Corp\nAll she ever do is ask me what I eat meat for\u2014\nHold up, pause. Always over the quota\nBoss, wake up in polo, sleep in Lacoste\nTravel across the world, but that didn't phase me\nCouple people that I know that happen to play me\nOnce they start to realize that I'm actually crazy\nShit, I'm actually crazy... um, and\nQ's phone gettin' blown up by Lyor Cohen\nChristian Dior, nothin' I'm ownin'\nGo to Hawaii, fuck with Samoans\nGet faded and sleep in the oceans\nKeep it in motion\nI'm rollin'\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I'm rollin'\nKeep it in motion\nI'm rollin', yeah\nAnd your bitch wearin' elbow pads\nSell her pussy over Melrose Ave\nI've been to hell and back tryna get attached to my better half\nNever that, the smile's so gone, so bring the coke on\nI'm higher than Voltron, with a bunch of gold on\nCaucasians still love me like my name was Michael Bolton\nHold on, do you fuckin' dirty like the soap gone\nFroze on, it's bone chillin', colder than the Pope's secrets\nOlder than Capone's demons, comin' from a place where there was no Jesus\nWalkin' bo-hemoth, I increase the feces\n'Cause shit real, fly into your windshield and get killed\nBuggin' out, had it all, I'm nothin' now\nI just gave it away\nFuck a label, Cain and Abel, put a name to a face\nUm, yeah\nI bust your speakers with some bullshit rap\nI'm on drugs, all my new shit wack\nRemember that\nI ain't shit but a fraud\nBut everyone I know ain't nothin' to a god\nBut everyone I know ain't nothin' to God\n23Embed"

I need a few to roll (Raw)\nI'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know\nSomebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down (Stop, man! Please, please, please, please!)\nHe's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now (Bapapapapam! Ah!)\nHe'll regret it when I hit the ground (What did I do?)\nFor now, everybody gather round\n\nIt's happy birthday (Woo)\nIt's a birthday party (Yeah)\nYeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)\nIt's your birthday party (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)\nYeah, happy birthday (Yeah)\nIt's your birthday party (Come on)\nHappy birthday (Come on, come on)\nYeah, happy birthday (Come on, come on)\nYeah, okay\nHappy birthday (Thanks)\nHow the fuck you feel? (Good)\nDo you ever sit and wonder what is real? (Huh?)\nDo you ever reach to touch her but there's nothin' there? (There)\nDo you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? (Care)\nDoes she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? (No)\nDid you hear about a heaven, now you runnin' there? (Go)\nDo you think about the fantasy and make-believe? (Okay)\nDo you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? (Look)\nLately, I've been havin' strange dreams (Uh-huh)\nParanoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy\nBaby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? (Uh-huh)\nYou can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you (Let's go, let's go, let's go)\nI do see myself as iconic (Yah)\nGettin' high my downfall, it's kinda ironic\nLike a condom, they on it (Woah)\nGot 'em in my pocket (Woah)\nNo time to worry, hurry up and light the candles\nEverybody\n\nHappy birthday (Woo)\nIt's a birthday party (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)\nYeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)\nIt's your birthday party (Everybody sing along)\nYeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)\nIt's your birthday party (Everybody sing along, come on)\nHappy birthday (Come on)\nYeah, happy birthday, uh (Come on, come on, come on, come on)\nWoo!\nHappy birthday\nTo you\nHappy birthday\nTo you\nHappy birthday\nTo you\nTo you\nWoo-hoo17Embed"

None of your fuckin' beeswax\nThese raps bring a joint together like a kneecap\nFuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at\nThe time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em\nTryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium\nFools I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian\nFake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'\nI'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions\nHow do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted\nI strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet\nThe bottom barrel of society\nI tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me\nI'm finer than the winery\nTake it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)\nFinally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see\nCome and die with me\n'Cause everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\nSaid everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\nYeah, said everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\nSaid everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\n\nYeah, um\nOkay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah\nThese other rappers just a diet soda\nI find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements\nThis a marathon, gentlemen, go 'head and start the races\nSave the coffin spaces\nYou'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation\nRappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas\nLava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon\nOnly God can save him, I heard the monsters made him\nI ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations\nContemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD\nLost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be\nYou can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks\nBitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke\nGordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete\nBeen a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history\nLook at what you did to me, look at what you did to me\nRun into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free\nNo bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial\nI been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal\nTreat you like a urinal\n'Cause everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\nSaid everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\nYeah, said everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies\nSaid everybody got dead homies\nOn the dead homies518Embed"
